## Briefly write about the project that you have submitted from the perspective of the user.
It's a simple food ordering site that can be used by any restaurant owner to use it for their use who just wants to cook food but not have the proper place or outlet for sit-and-eat service.

## Assumptions you have made for this project?
• The restaurant owner using this site doesn't has any prior space or dining area for customers.
• The user doesn't has any prior knowledge of website handling thus its user interface is made very easy and understandable.
• The user has a variety of food items to serve and has their variations available.
• The user wants to run an online enterprise of food serving business.

## Did you learn anything new while doing this assignment? Please explain.
Yes, a lot. I learned teamwork, team leadership, web content updating along with JSON, jQuery practices, bootstrap classes use and compression techniques.

## How much time did it take for you complete the project?
It took me  20, 30 days to complete the frontend details of this project. Further work of backend and database work was done by other members of team.

## If you had more time, what enhancements will you make?
There's still a lot to be added to this project like separate aboutus and contactus page, further specs of food items could be added further along with separate app design for similar idea.

# What was your motivation behind choosing this evaluation mode and the project?
Being a huge foody and being unable to go to restaurants during this pandemic, this idea struck me that what if restaurant just cooks food and dellivers instead of actually having the customer there at the outlet. Thus, I got my friends together and we statrted this project.
