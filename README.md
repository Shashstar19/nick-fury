##This website is dedicated to those food restaurants which during this pandemic time can't serve customers at their outlet thus, providing online food ordering services. 
It's a simple user interface that enables user to go through food items, select them, make ammendments and pay through cash or other payment methods.The main load of this project is on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Basic HTML, bootstrap, css combiantion has helped creating an easy design and rendering site. Some additional features are yet to be added and will soon be updated.
